Depends on a D compiler and my arsd repo downloaded locally called `arsd` under the current dir

https://github.com/adamdruppe/arsd

get master. I'm editing that as i go in here.

then `dmd -i browserjam.d` will hopefully work.

It uses lots of arsd code, but I wrote virtually all of what it uses from there, and it isn't using the prepackaged webview so i don't think it is cheating too much lol

as of right now, it does not load images or website css. those MIGHT come soon.

can't display tables. no list item markers. just super basic text.

but you can click links and go backward and forward so it feels like a browser :)
