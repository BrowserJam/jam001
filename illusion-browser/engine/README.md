# Zephr
A work in progress game engine written in Odin.

## Dependencies
#### Linux
Debian-based dependencies are

```bash
libxcursor-dev - libfreetype-dev - libx11-dev
```

#### Windows
C/C++ toolchain and the Windows SDK to be able to compile the engine.

## Games using Zephr
Right now the only game using Zephr is my own 2048 clone, the engine was developed alongside the game and doesn't do much as of now.
I plan on making more games and improving the engine as I go.
